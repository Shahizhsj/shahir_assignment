# Assignment Interfaces Deployment

## Overview
Each problem in the assignment has been provided with an interface using Gradio, and both interfaces have been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and interaction.

### Problem 1: Interface
The first problem's assignment files are stored in `vertext_1`. An interface has been created using Gradio and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. You can check it out using the link below:
